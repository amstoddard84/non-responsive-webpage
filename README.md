## SheCodes Coding Workshop Project

This is my project built in August 2020 for the first SheCodes coding workshop, which taught the foundations of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
The assignment was to create a basic, non-responsive webpage to demonstrate the basics that we learned.
For my project, I adapted a book marketing blog post I had previously published to my [author website](https://www.amstoddardbooks.com/) into a static webpage. 
(Please note that the demonstrated JavaScript is merely for show; the email field at the bottom of the page does not actually collect your email and add it to any sort of database.)
